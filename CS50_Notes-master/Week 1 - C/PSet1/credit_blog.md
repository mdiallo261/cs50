## Not My Finest Hour

I was going to go into a full breakdown of how I completed this problem, but I'm not too proud of my solution. Yes, it does work, but there's a lot of repetitive code. While I was able to figure out the checksum algorithm, I couldn't figure out an algorithm to find the lengths and first digits of the credit cards.

What I ended up doing is copy/pasting that algorithm multiple times for each card. It's too long, very repetitive, and messy. It does work, I tested the PayPal numbers, but I really wish the code was better.

Normally I'm happy if the code just works, it doesn't need to be perfect. But with this one, it still bugs me. Sure it does what it's supposed to do, except the solution is so unideal. I even looked up what other people did and I was really confused.

I'll go back to this problem sometime in the future, I have to so I know my coding has progressed.
