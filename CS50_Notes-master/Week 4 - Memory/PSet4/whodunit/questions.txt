1. What’s stdint.h?
This library defines integer types and gives each time a minimum and maximum, as well as an alias(typedef)

2. What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
These are typedefs from stdint.h that refer to the amount of bits used for common data types:
unsigned integers, characters, doubles, long longs, etc

3. How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
BYTE 1-byte
DWORD 4-bytes
LONG 4-bytes
WORD 2-bytes

4. What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
14 and 40

5. What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
bfSize, which is in the BITMAPFILEHEADER struct, refers to the size of the actual file
biSize, in the BITMAPINFOHEADER struct, is for the image dimensions

6. What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
The image is stored from top to bottom.

7. What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
biXPelsPerMeter and biYPelsPerMeter;

8. Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
In case the pointer was originally set to NULL, which would throw a Segmentation Fault

9. Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
There's only quantity required, it's not part of an array or anything, just the one bitmap image

10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
12

11. What does fseek do?
skips over the padding, fast-forwards it, if there's any padding

12. What is SEEK_CUR?
It's a given location for the file pointer
