# Scratch Notes

### Sprites

- Every object is a sprite
- Each sprite has a script, which is a set of instructions
- Sprites can be chosen in the program, built, or uploaded
- Costumes alter sprite appearance according to conditions

---

#### Stages are a background, which are also chosen from the program, built, or uploaded.

### Scratch Programming

- Statements are where actions occur
- Loops can go on forever, until a value is reach, or until a condition is met
- Scratch variables contain string or number values. These variables can be globally or locally scoped
- Broadcast events are used for sprite communication. They need to be sent and received.
- Scratch is multi-threaded, so different events can fire off at once
